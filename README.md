# Automove
A program that automates finding properties on rightmove.

## Motivation
Automation is an area of interest to me and I wanted to find ways to implement what I have learned.  
Seeing friends spend afternoons combing through properties on different websites and creating lists of the properties they liked, sparked the idea of automating the entire process, using the tools I had been learning.  
This also provided the opportunity to work on creating ReadMe's which is an area I realize need some more work.

## Built with:
    * **Python**
